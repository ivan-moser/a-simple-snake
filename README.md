In this little minigame, we have implemented skins, game states, and basic snake operations.
We are currently working to add some cool features like:
* Login page
* Multiplayer
* In-game chat
* AI-powered CPU player
* Leaderboards
* Stats

## Help

The commands are very simple; in fact, there are just a few:
* Pause: SPACE BAR
* Up: W / &uarr;
* Right: D / &rarr;
* Down: S / &darr;
* Left: A / &larr;
* Reset the game: RESET BUTTON
* Change skin: COLORED BUTTONS AT THE BOTTOM
